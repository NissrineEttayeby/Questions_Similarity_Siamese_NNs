# Question Similarity with Siamese Neural Networks
This project focuses on developing a system for learning question similarity using Siamese Neural Networks. The goal is to address the question retrieval task, which is relevant in platforms like Quora and Stack Overflow, where identifying similar questions is crucial for users seeking answers within a community.

# Data
The Quora Question Pairs Dataset is utilized for training and testing. You can download the dataset from the following link:
